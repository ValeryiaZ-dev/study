This repository for public the results of homework assigments in the training courses.

hw1: write code for a one-dimensional cellular automaton.

hw2: Skills in linking Python libraries with C/C++ programs.
hw2_1: Implement the classical operations of square matrix multiplication and vector matrix multiplication in C/C++.
hw2_2: Split the program into several modules and build it through static linking.
hw2_3: Prepare two assemblies with the -g and -O3 flags and measure the execution times for operations with N = 512, 1024, ... , 4096.
hw2_4: Execute a procedure call from Python via CTypes/Cython/PyBind11 and measure the time.
hw2_7: Implement the Strassen method of square matrix multiplication.

hw3: Skills - GPU in Python via cupy.
hw3_1: Write functions to filter images on CPU and GPU. Filter can be selected.
hw3_2_3: Write functions to output a histogram of a black and white image on the CPU and GPU. Compare the speeds of these two implementations.

hw4: Skills - graph problems.
1) Find and prepare a dataset of the Moscow or London underground to solve a standard Pagerank problem. Display the top 5 underground stations according to such ranking.
2) Apply the Simrank method to the Moscow subway graph.
3) Generate random sparse graphs and compare the performance of Pagerank implementations with and without CSR format.

And trying to make neural networks (CV).
